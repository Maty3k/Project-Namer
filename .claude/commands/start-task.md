# Start The Next Task

We are going to start working on the next task in the current spec. Before we get started, you need to ensure that the following things are true:

1. We are on the branch that corresponds to the spec.
2. That branch is up to date with any changes from remote.

If you cannot get into that state, tell me the problem and wait for me to help you.

We are going to create a new branch targeting this branch. Complete the next task in the spec's task list.

**IMPORTANT -** As you complete each subtask and the main task, mark them as completed in the task list.

When you have finished your work, do the following:

1. Run composer ready and fix any errors that appear. Keep running it until it is error-free.
2. Double check that all completed tasks and subtasks are checked off
3. Create a pull request targeting the spec branch
