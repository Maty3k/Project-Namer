> Spec: UI/UX Critical Fixes
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical UI/UX issues preventing core functionality: non-working generate names button and missing logo gallery display. These issues block users from using the main features of the application.

## User Stories

### Generate Names Functionality
As a user, I want to click the "Generate Names" button and receive AI-generated business names, so that I can find suitable names for my project.

**Detailed Workflow:** User enters business description, selects generation mode, clicks generate button, and receives a list of generated names with domain availability status.

### Logo Gallery Access  
As a user, I want to view and browse previously generated logos in a gallery interface, so that I can review and download logos I've created.

**Detailed Workflow:** User navigates to logo section, views thumbnails of generated logos, can filter/search logos, and access individual logo details and downloads.

## Spec Scope

1. **Generate Names Button Fix** - Diagnose and repair the non-functional name generation button
2. **Logo Gallery Implementation** - Create a complete logo gallery interface for viewing generated logos
3. **Logo Gallery Integration** - Ensure logo gallery connects properly with existing logo generation system
4. **User Flow Testing** - Verify both features work seamlessly in the complete user workflow

## Out of Scope

- New logo generation features
- Advanced logo editing capabilities
- Logo gallery advanced filtering (beyond basic search)
- Performance optimizations beyond basic functionality

## Expected Deliverable

1. Generate names button triggers AI name generation and displays results properly
2. Logo gallery displays all user-generated logos with thumbnail previews
3. Users can access individual logo details and download options from gallery
