> Spec: ChatGPT-Style Sidebar with Session Management
> Created: 2025-08-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the sidebar into a ChatGPT-style interface that manages naming sessions as conversations, provides comprehensive session history, and includes a focus mode for distraction-free name generation. This enhancement will create an intuitive experience that allows users to organize multiple naming projects, quickly start new sessions, revisit past work, and toggle between full interface and focused workspace modes.

## User Stories

### Session Management

As an entrepreneur working on multiple business ideas, I want to create and manage separate naming sessions like ChatGPT conversations, so that I can keep different projects organized and easily switch between them.

**Detailed workflow:** Users click a "New Session" button (similar to ChatGPT's "New Chat") to start fresh naming work. Each session automatically saves and appears in the sidebar history with a title derived from the business description. Users can click any previous session to instantly reload that context and continue where they left off.

### Searchable History

As a user with many past naming sessions, I want to search and filter my history to quickly find specific projects, so that I can reference previous work and build upon past ideas.

**Detailed workflow:** The sidebar displays a chronological list of all sessions with timestamps and preview text. A search bar at the top allows filtering by keywords. Sessions are grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, Previous 7 Days, etc.) for easy scanning. Users can rename, delete, or star important sessions for quick access.

### Focus Mode

As a user wanting to concentrate on name generation without distractions, I want to hide the sidebar completely to maximize workspace, so that I can focus entirely on the creative process.

**Detailed workflow:** Users click a focus mode toggle that smoothly slides the sidebar out of view, expanding the main content to full width. A subtle floating button or keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + /) brings the sidebar back. The mode persists across sessions based on user preference.

## Spec Scope

1. **ChatGPT-Style Session Management** - New session creation button, automatic session saving, and session switching
2. **Session History Interface** - Chronological session list with titles, timestamps, and preview text
3. **Search and Filtering** - Full-text search across session history with date-based grouping
4. **Focus Mode Toggle** - Collapsible sidebar with smooth animations and persistent user preference
5. **Session Actions** - Rename, delete, duplicate, and star/favorite functionality for sessions

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaboration on sessions
- Session sharing between users
- AI-powered session suggestions
- Voice-controlled navigation
- Desktop application integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can create unlimited naming sessions with one click, each maintaining its own state and history
2. All sessions are searchable and organized chronologically with intuitive grouping
3. Focus mode provides distraction-free workspace with smooth transitions and easy toggle
4. The interface matches familiar ChatGPT patterns for immediate user understanding
