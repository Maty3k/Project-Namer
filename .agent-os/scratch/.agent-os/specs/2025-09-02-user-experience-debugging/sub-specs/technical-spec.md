## Approach Options

**Option A:** Multiple Third-Party Services

- Cons: Higher cost, multiple integrations to maintain, data scattered across platforms

**Option B:** Custom Analytics with Open Source Tools (Selected)
- Pros: Full control, cost-effective, single codebase, privacy-compliant
- Cons: More development time, requires maintenance, less advanced features initially

**Option C:** Hybrid Approach - Mix of Custom and SaaS
- Pros: Balance of features and control, selective cost optimization
- Cons: Complex architecture, multiple systems to maintain

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best alignment with the open-source nature of the project while giving complete control over user data and customization capabilities. This approach allows for gradual feature expansion and maintains consistency with the existing TALL stack architecture.
