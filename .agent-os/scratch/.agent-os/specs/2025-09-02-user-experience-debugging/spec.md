## Overview

Implement comprehensive user experience debugging tools and analytics to identify and resolve UX issues in the AI-powered name generation application. This system will provide insights into user behavior, performance bottlenecks, and interface friction points to continuously improve the user journey.

## User Stories

### UX Analytics Dashboard

As a product developer, I want to access detailed user behavior analytics, so that I can identify where users encounter friction in the name generation workflow.

**Detailed Workflow:** The system will track user interactions, session durations, abandonment points, and feature usage patterns. Analytics will be presented in a dashboard showing key metrics like conversion rates from idea input to name selection, most common exit points, and performance indicators across different user segments.

### Error Tracking and Monitoring  

As a developer, I want to automatically capture and categorize frontend errors and UX issues, so that I can proactively fix problems before they impact more users.

**Detailed Workflow:** Implement comprehensive error logging that captures JavaScript errors, API failures, slow loading times, and user interface glitches. The system will categorize errors by severity, frequency, and user impact, providing detailed context including browser information, user actions leading to the error, and suggested resolution paths.

### User Session Recording and Heatmaps

As a UX designer, I want to observe real user sessions and interaction patterns, so that I can identify usability issues and optimization opportunities.

**Detailed Workflow:** Integrate session recording tools that capture user interactions, mouse movements, and click patterns while respecting privacy. Generate heatmaps showing where users focus attention, which buttons are most/least used, and where users experience confusion or hesitation in the interface.

## Spec Scope

1. **Analytics Integration** - Implement Google Analytics 4 and custom event tracking for name generation workflows
2. **Error Monitoring System** - Set up Sentry or similar service for comprehensive error tracking and alerting  
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Add Core Web Vitals tracking and performance budgets for key user journeys
4. **User Feedback Collection** - Create in-app feedback mechanisms and satisfaction surveys
5. **A/B Testing Framework** - Establish infrastructure for testing UI/UX improvements and feature variations

## Out of Scope

- Advanced business intelligence or data warehouse implementation
- Third-party analytics platform customizations beyond standard configurations  
- Real-time chat support or customer service integrations
- Marketing automation or email campaign analytics

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional analytics dashboard** showing key UX metrics accessible to development team
2. **Automated error detection and alerting** with categorized error reports and resolution tracking
3. **User behavior insights** including session recordings and interaction heatmaps for critical user flows
