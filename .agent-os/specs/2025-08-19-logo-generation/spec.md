## Overview

Implement AI-powered logo generation functionality that creates visual brand assets for selected business names, providing users with complete branding inspiration from name to visual identity. This feature enhances the naming workflow by offering immediate visual representation options, helping users envision their complete brand identity.

## User Stories

### Logo Generation for Selected Names

As an indie hacker, I want to generate logo concepts for my favorite business names, so that I can visualize the complete brand identity before making final naming decisions.

When a user selects one or more business names from their generation results, they can click a "Generate Logos" button to create multiple logo variations. The system will use AI image generation APIs to create logos in different styles (Minimalist, Modern, Playful, Corporate) based on the business name and any context from their original business description. The logos are clearly marked as inspiration only, with disclaimers encouraging users to hire professional designers or use the concepts as starting points for their own designs.

### Style-Based Logo Variations

As a product agency, I want to generate logos in different artistic styles, so that I can present diverse branding directions to my clients.

Users can select from predefined logo styles including Minimalist, Modern, Playful, and Corporate. Each style generates 2-3 logo variations, resulting in 8-12 total logo concepts per generation request. The system provides clear visual examples of each style and allows users to generate additional variations within their preferred styles.

### Color Customization and Export

As a solo developer, I want to customize the colors of generated logos and export them in multiple formats, so that I can adapt the designs to match my brand preferences and share concepts with collaborators.

Users can select from a curated color palette of 8-10 professional color schemes (including monochrome, blue tones, green tones, warm colors, etc.) and apply them to any generated logo. The system maintains the original design structure while intelligently replacing colors. Customized logos can be exported in both SVG (scalable vector) and PNG (raster) formats with proper file naming conventions that incorporate the business name, style type, and color scheme.

## Spec Scope

1. **AI Logo Generation** - Integrate with DALL-E or equivalent API to create logo images based on business names and style preferences

3. **Color Customization System** - Provide curated color palette options that can be applied to any generated logo design
4. **Logo Display Gallery** - Present generated logos in an organized grid layout with color customization controls and download options
5. **Smart Color Replacement** - Intelligent color mapping system that preserves design integrity while applying new color schemes
6. **Export Functionality** - Enable SVG and PNG downloads for original and color-customized logos with proper naming conventions
7. **Integration with Naming Flow** - Seamlessly connect logo generation with existing name generation results

## Out of Scope

## Expected Deliverable
