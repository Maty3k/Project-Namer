# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-19-logo-generation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-19
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Integration with OpenAI DALL-E 3 API for logo image generation
- SVG color manipulation system for intelligent color replacement
- Storage system for generated logo files using Laravel Storage with S3/local disk support
- Image processing capabilities for format conversion (SVG to PNG, resizing, optimization)
- Color palette management system with predefined professional color schemes
- Real-time SVG color preview functionality using client-side processing
- Batch processing system for generating multiple logo variations simultaneously
- File download system with proper MIME types and security headers
- Rate limiting and cost management for AI API usage
- Caching mechanism to avoid regenerating identical logo requests
- Responsive gallery layout using FluxUI Pro components with color picker interface
- File naming convention system incorporating business names, style identifiers, and color scheme names

## Approach Options

**Option A: DALL-E 3 Integration** (Selected)
- Pros: High-quality results, reliable API, good text integration in logos
- Cons: Higher cost per generation, OpenAI dependency

**Option B: Stable Diffusion via Replicate**
- Pros: Lower cost, more control over models
- Cons: Less consistent quality, more complex prompt engineering

**Option C: Multiple API Fallback System**
- Pros: Redundancy, cost optimization opportunities
- Cons: Complex implementation, inconsistent results across providers

**Rationale:** DALL-E 3 provides the most consistent, high-quality logo generation with excellent text integration, which is crucial for business name incorporation. The cost is justified by the quality and the "inspiration only" positioning reduces liability concerns.

## Color Customization Approach

**SVG-First Strategy** (Selected)
- Generate logos as SVG format for maximum color manipulation flexibility
- Use DOM parsing to identify color elements (fill, stroke attributes)
- Implement intelligent color mapping algorithms that preserve design hierarchy
- Convert to PNG after color customization for final download

**Pros:** Complete control over colors, scalable results, professional output quality
**Cons:** More complex implementation, requires SVG processing expertise

**Alternative: Pre-generated Color Variants**
- Generate multiple color versions of each logo during initial creation
- Store all variants and present as selection options
- Simple implementation with predictable results

**Rationale for SVG-First:** Provides maximum flexibility with professional results while keeping storage requirements manageable. Users get true customization rather than pre-selected options.

## External Dependencies

- **OpenAI API (DALL-E 3)** - Primary AI image generation service
  - **Justification:** Industry-leading image quality with reliable text integration capabilities
  - **Rate Limits:** 5 requests per minute per API key
  - **Cost:** ~$0.04 per 1024x1024 image

- **Laravel Storage** - File management and storage abstraction
  - **Justification:** Built-in Laravel functionality for handling file uploads, storage, and downloads

- **Intervention/Image** - PHP image manipulation library
  - **Justification:** Needed for image format conversion, resizing, and optimization of generated logos

- **DOMDocument/SimpleXML** - PHP XML parsing for SVG manipulation
  - **Justification:** Built-in PHP functionality for parsing and modifying SVG color attributes

## Logo Style Prompting Strategy

### Minimalist Style
- Clean, simple geometric shapes
- Limited color palette (1-2 colors)
- Sans-serif typography focus
- Emphasis on negative space

### Modern Style
- Contemporary design trends
- Gradient colors and effects
- Sleek typography combinations
- Tech-forward aesthetic

### Playful Style
- Vibrant colors and fun elements
- Rounded shapes and friendly typography
- Cartoon-like or illustrative elements
- Approachable and energetic feeling

### Corporate Style
- Professional and trustworthy appearance
- Traditional color schemes (blues, grays)
- Serif or refined sans-serif fonts
- Balanced and symmetrical layouts

## Curated Color Schemes

### Professional Color Palettes (10 schemes)

1. **Monochrome** - Black, white, and grays for timeless elegance
2. **Ocean Blue** - Deep blues and teals for trust and reliability  
3. **Forest Green** - Natural greens for growth and sustainability
4. **Warm Sunset** - Oranges and warm reds for energy and creativity
5. **Royal Purple** - Purple tones for luxury and innovation
6. **Corporate Navy** - Navy blue with silver accents for professionalism
7. **Earthy Tones** - Browns and tans for authenticity and stability
8. **Tech Blue** - Modern blues with electric accents for technology brands
9. **Vibrant Pink** - Modern pinks for creative and lifestyle brands
10. **Charcoal Gold** - Dark grays with gold accents for premium positioning

Each palette contains 3-4 harmonious colors: primary, secondary, accent, and neutral tones.

## File Management Strategy

- Store original logos in `storage/app/public/logos/{session_id}/originals/` directory
- Store color-customized versions in `storage/app/public/logos/{session_id}/customized/` directory  
- Use UUID-based file naming: `{business_name}-{style}-{variation}-{color_scheme}-{uuid}.{ext}`
- Implement automatic cleanup of files older than 30 days
- Generate SVG as primary format, convert to PNG on-demand for downloads
- PNG resolution: 512x512px for web display, 1024x1024px for download
- Cache color-customized versions to avoid repeated SVG processing
