This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-sharing-saving/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**ShareService**
- Creates public shares with unique UUIDs and proper URLs
- Creates password-protected shares with bcrypt hashing
- Validates share expiration dates and handles expired shares
- Generates social media metadata with proper Open Graph tags
- Handles rate limiting and prevents spam share creation

**ExportService**
- Generates PDF exports with proper formatting and branding
- Creates CSV exports with headers and proper escaping
- Produces JSON exports with complete data structure
- Handles large datasets efficiently without memory issues
- Validates file generation and cleanup processes

**Share Model**
- UUID generation is unique and URL-safe
- Password hashing uses bcrypt with proper salt
- Polymorphic relationships work correctly with name generations
- Expiration logic functions properly with time-based queries
- Access tracking updates view counts and timestamps accurately

**Export Model**
- File path generation follows secure naming conventions
- Polymorphic relationships link to correct generation data
- Download tracking increments properly
- Cleanup logic removes expired exports correctly

### Integration Tests

**Share Creation Workflow**
- Complete share creation from name generation to public URL
- Password protection setup and authentication flow
- Share settings updates reflect immediately in database
- Rate limiting blocks excessive share creation attempts
- Email notifications (if implemented) send properly

**Export Generation Workflow**
- End-to-end PDF generation with realistic name data
- CSV export includes all required fields and formatting
- JSON export maintains data integrity and structure
- File download process serves correct Content-Type headers
- Cleanup job removes expired exports on schedule

**Public Share Viewing**
- Public shares display correctly without authentication
- Password-protected shares require valid credentials
- Access tracking records IP addresses and user agents
- Social media sharing generates proper meta tags
- Mobile responsiveness works across different devices

### Feature Tests

**Share Management Dashboard**
- Users can view list of their created shares with pagination
- Share editing updates title, description, and settings
- Share deletion removes access but preserves analytics
- Search and filtering work across share titles and descriptions
- Analytics display view counts and access patterns

**Public Share Experience**
- Shared pages load quickly with optimized queries
- Name lists display with domain availability status
- Password protection prevents unauthorized access
- Social sharing generates rich previews on platforms
- Mobile interface provides excellent user experience

**Export and Download System**
- Export generation completes within reasonable timeframes
- Downloaded files open correctly in appropriate applications
- Large exports handle memory management properly
- Export history tracks user download behavior
- Expired exports clean up automatically

### Security Tests

**Authentication and Authorization**
- Only authorized users can create shares for their generations
- Password-protected shares require correct authentication
- Share UUIDs cannot be enumerated or guessed
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- CSRF protection works on all share management actions

**Data Privacy**
- Expired shares become inaccessible immediately
- Deleted shares remove all associated data properly
- Access logs do not expose sensitive information
- Export files are stored securely and cleaned up
- Share passwords are hashed and never logged

### Performance Tests

**Share Loading Performance**
- Public share pages load in under 2 seconds
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Caching reduces repeated database hits effectively
- Large name lists paginate properly for performance
- CDN integration works for static assets

**Export Generation Performance**
- PDF generation completes within 10 seconds for typical datasets
- CSV exports handle thousands of names efficiently
- Memory usage stays within acceptable limits during exports
- Concurrent export requests don't overwhelm system
- Background job processing maintains system responsiveness

## Mocking Requirements

**External Services**
- Social media API responses for sharing validation
- PDF generation library for consistent test outputs
- File storage operations for upload/download simulation
- Email service (if notifications are implemented)
- CDN integration for asset serving tests

**System Resources**
- File system operations for export storage and cleanup
- Memory usage monitoring during large export generation
- Network requests for social media sharing validation
- Time-based operations for expiration testing

## Test Data Factories

**Share Factory**
- Generate shares with various types (public/protected)
- Create shares with different expiration scenarios
- Populate realistic access analytics data
- Associate with existing name generation data

**Export Factory**
- Generate exports in all supported formats
- Create realistic file sizes and paths
- Set up expiration dates for cleanup testing
- Link to appropriate generation and user data

## Test Environment Setup

- Database seeding with realistic name generation data
- File storage configuration for export testing
- Cache configuration for performance testing
- Rate limiting configuration for security testing
- Social media API keys for integration testing (test environment)
