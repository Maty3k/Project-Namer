> Spec: Sidebar UI Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the current basic sidebar into a polished, professional navigation interface that enhances user experience through improved visual design, better organization, and accessibility compliance. This enhancement will provide a more intuitive and visually appealing navigation system that aligns with the product's professional image for indie hackers and developers.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Visual Experience

As an indie hacker using the name generation tool, I want an aesthetically pleasing and professional sidebar navigation, so that I feel confident using and recommending the application to others.

**Detailed workflow:** Users will immediately notice improved visual hierarchy, better spacing, modern styling, and cohesive branding when they access the application. The sidebar will feel premium and trustworthy, encouraging longer engagement with the platform.

### Improved Navigation Organization

As a user working on multiple naming projects, I want clearly organized navigation with intuitive groupings and visual feedback, so that I can efficiently move between different features and understand my current location within the application.

**Detailed workflow:** Users will see clear visual separation between primary features (name generation), secondary tools (logo gallery), and support resources. Current page indicators, hover states, and logical grouping will make navigation effortless and reduce cognitive load.

### Mobile-First Touch Experience

As a mobile user generating names on my phone or tablet, I want touch-friendly navigation with appropriate sizing and responsive behavior, so that I can use all features comfortably on smaller screens.

**Detailed workflow:** Mobile users will experience optimally sized touch targets, smooth animations, and intuitive gesture support. The sidebar will collapse/expand smoothly and maintain usability across all device sizes.
