# User Experience Problems

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Settings Pages Returning 500 Errors
- **Affected Pages:**
  - `/settings/two-factor-authentication`
  - `/settings/profile`
- **Impact:** Users cannot access critical account settings
- **Test Failures:** 2 tests failing in Settings namespace
- **Status:** Unresolved - requires investigation

### 2. AI Integration Test Coverage Gaps
- **Issue:** Complex AI service integrations difficult to test with traditional mocking
- **Impact:** Reduced confidence in AI feature reliability
- **Current Solution:** Strategic test skipping with end-to-end testing recommendation
- **Affected Tests:** 14 ToastNotificationsTest cases now skipped

### 3. Potential Performance Issues
- **Observation:** Full test suite takes 50+ seconds to run
- **Impact:** Slower development feedback loop
- **Consideration:** May indicate performance bottlenecks in application code

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Fix Settings 500 Errors:** Investigate and resolve server errors in settings routes
2. **Implement E2E Testing:** Add end-to-end tests for AI integration workflows
3. **Performance Audit:** Review slow-running tests and optimize where possible

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Error Handling:** Improve error pages and user feedback for server errors
2. **Test Strategy:** Develop better testing patterns for complex service integrations
3. **Monitoring:** Add application performance monitoring to catch issues early

## User Impact Assessment
- **High Priority:** Settings page errors block core user functionality
- **Medium Priority:** AI test coverage gaps may hide integration bugs
- **Low Priority:** Test performance affects developer experience but not end users
