# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-ai-integration-prism/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-01
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### AI Service Architecture
- Extend existing OpenAINameService to support multiple models using Prism's unified interface
- Create PrismAIService as abstraction layer supporting GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Grok-Beta
- Implement model-specific prompt optimization and parameter tuning for each AI provider
- Add intelligent fallback system when primary model is unavailable or rate-limited
- Support concurrent requests to multiple models for comparison features

### Dashboard Integration
- Add "Generate Names with AI" toggle to existing Dashboard create project form
- Integrate AI generation controls (model selection, mode, deep thinking) below description textarea  
- Stream AI results directly into NameSuggestion model creation for seamless Project Workflow integration
- Display generation progress with live updates and model-specific status indicators
- Handle generation errors gracefully with retry mechanisms and user feedback

### Project Page Enhancement
- Add "Generate More Names" floating action button to existing ProjectPage layout
- Create contextual AI prompts using existing project name, description, and selected name preferences
- Display new generations alongside existing suggestions using current NameResultCard system
- Implement generation history tracking and duplicate name prevention
- Add bulk actions for AI-generated suggestions (hide all, select best, regenerate)

### Multi-Model Comparison Interface
- Create tabbed interface showing results from each AI model with consistent NameResultCard display
- Implement model performance metrics (speed, creativity score, relevance rating)
- Add user preference learning system to prioritize preferred models over time
- Support partial results display when some models are still generating
- Include model-specific metadata (temperature, tokens used, generation time) for transparency

### Performance and Caching
- Implement intelligent caching strategy considering model, mode, and input parameters
- Add request queuing system to manage API rate limits across multiple models
- Use database transactions for batch NameSuggestion creation from AI results
- Optimize Prism client configuration for production load handling
- Monitor and log AI usage patterns for cost optimization

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Sequential Model Calling
- Pros: Simple implementation, predictable resource usage, easier error handling
- Cons: Slower user experience, no parallelization benefits

**Option B:** Parallel Model Calling with Queue Management (Selected)
- Pros: Faster results, better user experience, efficient resource utilization
- Cons: More complex implementation, requires sophisticated error handling

**Rationale:** Option B provides significantly better user experience by reducing wait times and allows for progressive result display, which aligns with the project's focus on AI-first development and user satisfaction.

## External Dependencies

- **Prism PHP SDK** - Already installed, latest version for multi-model support
  - Justification: Unified interface for multiple AI providers reduces integration complexity
- **OpenAI API** - GPT-4o model access for professional name generation
  - Justification: Industry-leading model for creative and business naming tasks
- **Anthropic Claude API** - Claude-3.5-Sonnet for nuanced, context-aware suggestions  
  - Justification: Excellent at understanding business context and brand positioning
- **Google AI API** - Gemini-1.5-Pro for diverse creative perspectives
  - Justification: Strong multilingual capabilities and creative reasoning
- **X.AI API** - Grok-Beta for edgy, innovative naming approaches
  - Justification: Unique perspective for tech startups and disruptive brands

## Integration Points

### Database Schema Updates
- Add `ai_model` and `generation_metadata` columns to existing name_suggestions table
- Create `ai_generations` table to track generation sessions and model performance
- Add indexes for efficient querying by model and generation parameters

### Livewire Component Architecture
- Extend existing Dashboard component with AI generation state management
- Enhance ProjectPage component with contextual generation capabilities  
- Create reusable AIModelSelector and GenerationModeControls components
- Integrate with existing NameResultCard system without modification

### API Integration Layer
- Create AIGenerationService as facade for multiple model interactions
- Implement async job processing for non-blocking AI generation
- Add comprehensive error handling for model-specific failures and timeouts
- Create unified response format regardless of underlying AI model

### User Experience Flow
- Maintain existing Project Workflow UI patterns and interactions
- Add AI features as optional enhancements to current manual workflow
- Ensure graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Preserve all existing functionality while adding AI-powered features
