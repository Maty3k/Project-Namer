## Overview

Implement a comprehensive photo gallery feature that allows users to upload, organize, and manage images related to their business naming projects. This feature will enable visual inspiration boards, brand mood boards, and reference image collections to complement the naming and logo generation process.

## User Stories

### Image Upload and Management
As a user, I want to upload images to create visual inspiration boards, so that I can better communicate my brand vision and aesthetic preferences.

**Detailed Workflow:** User navigates to photo gallery, clicks upload button, selects multiple images from their device, images are uploaded with progress indicators, and automatically organized into the current project's gallery with thumbnails generated.

### Visual Mood Board Creation
As a user, I want to organize uploaded images into mood boards, so that I can create cohesive visual themes for different naming directions.

**Detailed Workflow:** User creates a new mood board, gives it a name and description, drags and drops images from their gallery into the board, arranges them in a grid or collage layout, and can share the board with collaborators.

### Integration with Name Generation
As a user, I want to use my uploaded images as context for AI name generation, so that the AI can better understand my brand's visual identity.

**Detailed Workflow:** User selects images from their gallery when generating names, AI analyzes the visual elements and style, generates names that align with the visual aesthetic, and shows which images influenced each name suggestion.

### UI Color Customization
As a user, I want to customize the application's color scheme and theme, so that I can create a personalized interface that matches my brand or aesthetic preferences.

**Detailed Workflow:** User accesses theme settings from the main menu, selects from predefined color themes or creates a custom color palette, previews changes in real-time, applies the theme across all interface elements, and saves preferences for future sessions.
