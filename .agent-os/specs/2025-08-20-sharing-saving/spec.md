> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive sharing and saving functionality that allows users to create shareable public URLs for their name generation results, export data in multiple formats, and share directly to social media platforms. This feature enhances user engagement by making it easy to share and collaborate on naming decisions with team members and stakeholders.

## User Stories

### Shareable URLs for Collaboration

As a business owner, I want to generate a shareable public URL for my name generation results, so that I can easily share potential names with my team, investors, or focus groups for feedback and decision-making.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User completes a name generation session and reviews results
2. User clicks "Share" button to generate a public URL
3. System creates a unique, secure link that displays the name list with domain availability status
4. User can copy the URL and share via email, Slack, or other communication channels
5. Recipients can view the shared results without needing to create an account

### Private Password-Protected Sharing

As a product manager, I want to share sensitive project names with my team using password-protected links, so that confidential branding information remains secure while still allowing collaboration.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User selects names they want to share privately
2. User chooses "Private Share" option and sets a password
3. System generates a protected URL that requires the password to access
4. User shares both the URL and password with authorized team members
5. Recipients enter the password to view the shared content

### Export and Download Functionality

As a marketing consultant, I want to export name lists in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON), so that I can include them in client presentations, import into other tools, or maintain records for future reference.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User reviews their generated names and selects favorites
2. User clicks "Export" and chooses desired format (PDF, CSV, or JSON)
3. System generates formatted export with names, domain status, and generation metadata
4. User downloads the file for use in presentations or documentation
5. Exported files include branding and timestamp for professional presentation

## Spec Scope

1. **Public URL Sharing** - Generate shareable public links for name generation results with clean, accessible viewing interface
2. **Password-Protected Sharing** - Create private sharing links with password authentication and expiration options
3. **Multi-Format Export** - Export functionality supporting PDF (presentation-ready), CSV (data analysis), and JSON (developer-friendly) formats
4. **Social Media Integration** - Direct sharing buttons for Twitter and LinkedIn with pre-formatted posts
5. **Share Management Dashboard** - Interface to view, edit, and delete previously created shares with usage analytics

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing of shared lists
- User account requirements for viewing shared content
- Advanced permission management (view-only vs edit permissions)
- Integration with project management tools like Asana or Trello
- Email notification systems for share activity
- Bulk sharing of multiple generation sessions simultaneously

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Sharing System** - Users can generate public and private shareable URLs that display name generation results in a clean, mobile-responsive interface
2. **Working Export System** - Users can download their results in PDF, CSV, and JSON formats with proper formatting and metadata
3. **Social Media Integration** - Direct sharing to Twitter and LinkedIn with customizable post templates and proper link handling
