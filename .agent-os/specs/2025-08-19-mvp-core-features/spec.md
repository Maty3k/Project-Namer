## Overview

Implement the essential Phase 1 MVP functionality for the Domain Finder Application that enables users to input business ideas, generate AI-powered names using GPT-5, and check domain availability for core TLDs. This spec delivers a complete naming workflow from concept to available domain verification, establishing the foundation for all future enhancements.

## User Stories

### Entrepreneur Naming Workflow

As an indie hacker launching a new startup, I want to describe my business concept and receive AI-generated brandable names with domain availability, so that I can quickly identify usable names without manual brainstorming and tedious domain checking.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User opens the Domain Finder application
2. Enters business concept description in a clean textarea (up to 2000 characters)
3. Selects one of 4 AI generation modes (Creative, Professional, Brandable, Tech-focused)
4. Optionally enables "Deep Thinking Mode" for enhanced results
5. Submits request and receives 10 AI-generated names
6. Views results in a table showing name and domain availability for .com, .io, .co, .net
7. Reviews search history to compare with previous generations
8. Repeats process with different modes or refined input as needed

### Search History Management

As a user exploring multiple business concepts, I want to access my previous name generation sessions, so that I can compare different approaches and revisit promising results without losing my work.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User completes one or more name generation sessions
2. All searches are automatically saved to browser local storage
3. User can view last 30-50 generated names with timestamps in history section
4. Clicking on a previous search reloads those results
5. User can clear history for privacy when needed

### Deep Analysis Mode

As a user seeking higher-quality name suggestions, I want to use a "Deep Thinking Mode" that allows the AI more processing time, so that I receive more thoughtful, context-aware name suggestions for critical projects.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User toggles "Deep Thinking Mode" before generating names
2. AI receives enhanced prompts with more detailed context analysis
3. System shows extended loading indicator during longer processing
4. Results include more nuanced, carefully crafted name suggestions
5. User can compare standard vs. deep thinking results

## Spec Scope

1. **Idea Input Interface** - Clean, responsive textarea with 2000 character limit, input validation, and character counter
2. **AI Name Generation** - GPT-5 integration with 4 generation modes producing 10 names per request with error handling
3. **Results Display System** - Responsive table layout with visual domain availability indicators and loading states
4. **Basic Domain Checking** - Real-time availability verification for .com, .io, .co, .net with caching and error handling
5. **Search History Management** - Browser local storage of last 30-50 generated names with reload and clear functionality
6. **Deep Thinking Mode** - Enhanced AI processing mode with extended prompts and visual feedback for longer processing times

## Out of Scope

- Multiple AI model support (reserved for Phase 3)
- Logo generation functionality (reserved for Phase 2)
- Domain registration capabilities (reserved for Phase 3)
- User accounts and authentication
- Sharing and collaboration features
- Trademark checking integration
- Advanced filtering options
- Mobile-specific optimizations beyond responsive design

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional MVP Web Application** - Complete naming workflow from idea input to domain-verified results accessible via web browser
2. **Multi-Mode AI Integration** - Working GPT-5 API integration with 4 distinct generation modes producing consistent, quality results
3. **Real-Time Domain Verification** - Reliable domain checking system that accurately reports availability status for core TLDs within 3 seconds per domain
4. **Persistent Search History** - Browser-based history system that maintains user's last 30-50 generated names across sessions with clear management options
