> Spec: Enhanced UI/UX with FluxUI Pro
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Upgrade the application's user interface to leverage FluxUI Pro components, creating a more polished and professional experience with advanced interactive features. This enhancement will replace existing basic UI elements with Pro variants and implement sophisticated table management, modal dialogs, and notification systems to elevate the overall user experience.

## User Stories

### Professional Interface Enhancement

As a user generating business names, I want a polished, professional interface that feels modern and trustworthy, so that I have confidence in the tool and enjoy using it for my business needs.

The interface will feature clean Pro-grade components with consistent styling, smooth animations, and intuitive interactions. Users will experience visual polish that matches enterprise-grade applications while maintaining the simplicity that makes the tool accessible.

### Advanced Results Management

As a user reviewing generated names, I want to sort and filter results effectively, so that I can quickly find the most suitable options for my business without manually scanning through long lists.

The enhanced table system will provide click-to-sort functionality on columns like name length, domain availability status, and alphabetical order. Users can filter results by domain extension availability, name characteristics, or other criteria to narrow down their options efficiently.

### Contextual Information Access

As a user exploring name options, I want to view detailed information about each name in an organized modal dialog, so that I can make informed decisions without cluttering the main interface.

Modal dialogs will display comprehensive name details including domain pricing, alternative extensions, trademark considerations, and related suggestions. This keeps the main interface clean while providing deep information on demand.

## Spec Scope

1. **Component Upgrade Migration** - Systematic replacement of all basic FluxUI components with Pro variants throughout the application
2. **Advanced Table Implementation** - Sortable and filterable results tables with enhanced user interaction capabilities
3. **Modal Dialog System** - Contextual information displays and action confirmations using professional modal components
4. **Toast Notification Enhancement** - Multi-level notification system for user feedback with various types and persistence options
5. **Form Validation Improvement** - Real-time validation feedback with better visual indicators and error handling

## Out of Scope

- Complete visual design overhaul (maintaining existing layout structure)
- New functionality beyond UI/UX improvements
- Mobile-specific responsive adjustments (maintaining current responsive behavior)
- Performance optimization beyond component upgrades
- Integration with external design systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. All existing UI components upgraded to FluxUI Pro variants with enhanced styling and functionality
2. Results tables featuring sortable columns and filterable rows that users can interact with seamlessly
3. Modal dialogs accessible throughout the application for detailed information display and user actions
