## Test Data Management

### Factories

**LogoGenerationFactory**
```php
public function definition(): array
{
    return [
        'session_id' => 'sess_' . $this->faker->uuid(),
        'business_name' => $this->faker->company(),
        'business_description' => $this->faker->paragraph(),
        'status' => 'pending',
        'total_logos_requested' => 12,
        'logos_completed' => 0,
        'api_provider' => 'openai',
        'cost_cents' => 0,
    ];
}
```

**GeneratedLogoFactory**
```php
public function definition(): array
{
    return [
        'style' => $this->faker->randomElement(['minimalist', 'modern', 'playful', 'corporate']),
        'variation_number' => $this->faker->numberBetween(1, 3),
        'prompt_used' => $this->faker->paragraph(),
        'file_path' => 'logos/' . $this->faker->uuid() . '.png',
        'file_size' => $this->faker->numberBetween(10000, 100000),
        'image_width' => 1024,
        'image_height' => 1024,
        'generation_time_ms' => $this->faker->numberBetween(1000, 5000),
    ];
}
```
