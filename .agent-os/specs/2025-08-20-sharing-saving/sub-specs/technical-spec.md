# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-sharing-saving/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **URL Generation**: Secure, unique, URL-safe identifiers using Laravel's UUID or custom hash generation
- **Password Protection**: Bcrypt hashing for protected shares with session-based authentication
- **Export Generation**: PDF generation using DomPDF or similar, CSV using Laravel's response helpers, JSON using Laravel's API resources
- **Social Media Integration**: Meta tag generation for rich previews, OAuth integration for direct posting (optional)
- **Performance**: Caching of shared content views, optimized database queries for share lookups
- **Security**: Rate limiting on share creation, CSRF protection, input validation for passwords and share settings
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Shared pages must be fully responsive and accessible on all devices
- **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter Card support for shared URLs

## Approach Options

**Option A: Single Share Model Approach**
- Pros: Simple database schema, easy to implement, unified sharing interface
- Cons: May become complex as feature set grows, limited flexibility for different share types

**Option B: Polymorphic Sharing System (Selected)**
- Pros: Flexible architecture supporting multiple share types, extensible for future features, clean separation of concerns
- Cons: More complex initial implementation, requires careful relationship management

**Rationale:** Option B provides better long-term flexibility and follows Laravel best practices for polymorphic relationships. This approach allows easy extension for future sharing types (logo shares, individual name shares, etc.) while maintaining clean code organization.

## External Dependencies

- **DomPDF** - For PDF generation with custom styling and branding
  - **Justification:** Well-maintained Laravel package with excellent HTML-to-PDF conversion
- **Laravel Excel (Optional)** - Enhanced CSV export functionality with formatting
  - **Justification:** Provides advanced formatting options for professional CSV exports
- **Hashids (Optional)** - For generating short, URL-friendly share identifiers
  - **Justification:** Creates more user-friendly URLs compared to UUIDs

## Architecture Components

### Models
- `Share` - Main sharing model with polymorphic relationships
- `ShareAccess` - Track access analytics and usage statistics
- `ShareSettings` - Configuration for share appearance and behavior

### Controllers
- `ShareController` - Handle share creation and management
- `PublicShareController` - Public viewing of shared content
- `ExportController` - Handle file exports and downloads

### Services
- `ShareService` - Core sharing logic and URL generation
- `ExportService` - Handle multi-format exports
- `SocialMediaService` - Generate social media sharing metadata

### Middleware
- `SharePasswordMiddleware` - Handle password-protected share authentication
- `ShareRateLimitMiddleware` - Prevent abuse of sharing functionality

## Security Considerations

- All shared URLs use cryptographically secure random identifiers
- Password-protected shares use bcrypt hashing with proper salt
- Rate limiting prevents spam and abuse
- CSRF protection on all share management actions
- Input sanitization for all user-provided content
- Optional expiration dates for enhanced security
