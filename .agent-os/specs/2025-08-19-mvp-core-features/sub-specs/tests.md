### Test Data Fixtures

**Sample Business Descriptions**
```php
// Short description
"A productivity app for remote teams"

// Medium description  
"A productivity application that helps remote teams collaborate better through video meetings, shared workspaces, and real-time document editing"

// Long description (near 2000 character limit)
"[Comprehensive business description with detailed features, target market, competitive landscape, and technical requirements...]"

// Edge cases
"" // Empty description
"A" // Single character
"[2000+ character description]" // Exceeds limit
"Special chars !@#$%^&*(){}[]" // Special characters
```

**Sample Generated Names**
```php
[
    'TeamSync Pro', 'CollabSpace', 'RemoteFlow', 'WorkTogether', 
    'TeamBridge', 'ConnectHub', 'SyncPoint', 'TeamForge',
    'RemoteBase', 'WorkStream'
]
```

```php
[
    'teamsyncpro.com' => ['available' => false, 'checked_at' => '2025-08-19T10:30:00Z'],
    'teamsyncpro.io' => ['available' => true, 'checked_at' => '2025-08-19T10:30:00Z'],
