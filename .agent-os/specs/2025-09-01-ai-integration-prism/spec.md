> Spec: AI Integration with Prism for Project Workflow
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate comprehensive AI-powered name generation capabilities into the existing Project Workflow UI using Prism, supporting multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) with seamless user experience from project creation to name selection.

## User Stories

### AI-Powered Project Name Generation

As a user creating a new project, I want to generate AI-powered name suggestions directly from my project description, so that I can quickly discover creative and relevant names without leaving the project workflow.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
User enters project description in Dashboard, clicks "Generate Names with AI" button, selects AI model and generation mode, receives 10 suggestions displayed as NameResultCards with domain checking, and can immediately select, hide, or request more variations.

### Multiple AI Model Comparison

As a user exploring name options, I want to compare suggestions from different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Grok) side-by-side, so that I can leverage diverse AI perspectives and find the perfect name that resonates with my brand vision.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
User triggers multi-model generation from project page, sees tabbed interface showing results from each AI model, can filter by model preferences, compare naming styles, and select the best suggestions from any model for their project.

### Contextual AI Enhancement

As a user with an existing project, I want to generate additional name suggestions based on my current project context and any previously selected names, so that I can explore variations and alternatives that build on my established preferences.

**Detailed Workflow Description:**
From project page, user clicks "Generate More Names" with existing project context automatically included, AI uses current project name and description as context for enhanced suggestions, results integrate seamlessly with existing NameResultCard system.

## Spec Scope

1. **AI Generation Integration** - Seamless integration of Prism-based AI services into Dashboard and ProjectPage components with real-time name generation
2. **Multiple Model Support** - Support for GPT-4, Claude-3.5, Google Gemini Pro, and Grok with unified interface and model-specific optimizations  
3. **Generation Mode Controls** - UI controls for Creative, Professional, Brandable, and Tech-focused generation modes with Deep Thinking toggle
4. **Real-time Results** - Live streaming of AI results into existing NameResultCard components with progressive loading states
5. **Model Comparison Interface** - Side-by-side comparison view allowing users to evaluate different AI model outputs and select preferred suggestions

## Out of Scope

- Custom AI model training or fine-tuning capabilities
- Trademark checking integration (Phase 3 roadmap item)
- Domain registration workflow (Phase 3 roadmap item)
- Bulk generation for multiple projects simultaneously
- AI-generated logos integration (separate from name generation focus)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can generate AI names directly from Dashboard project creation with immediate NameSuggestion creation and display
2. Project pages include "Generate Names" button that creates new suggestions contextually aware of existing project details
3. Multi-model comparison interface allows users to see GPT vs Claude vs Gemini results in organized tabs with selection capabilities
