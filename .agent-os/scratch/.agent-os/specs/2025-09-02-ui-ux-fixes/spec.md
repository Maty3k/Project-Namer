## Overview

Fix critical user interface and user experience issues that are preventing optimal functionality and user flow in the Project Namer application. These fixes will improve button interactions, sidebar behavior, name generation functionality, and streamline the AI-first user experience.

## User Stories

### Generation Style Button Fix

As a user, I want to be able to toggle generation style buttons on and off so that I can change my selection or deselect options when needed.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users should be able to click generation style buttons (Creative, Professional, Brandable, Tech-focused) to select them, and click again to deselect them. Multiple selections should be possible, and users should have visual feedback showing which styles are currently selected with the ability to modify their choices.

### Clean Sidebar Experience

As a user, I want a completely clean sidebar when it's collapsed so that the interface looks minimal and uncluttered.

**Detailed Workflow:** When the sidebar is collapsed/closed, no text, letters, or labels should be visible. The collapsed state should show only colors or visual indicators without any textual elements like "P" for Project.

### Functional Generate More Names Button

As a user, I want the "Generate More Names" button to work properly so that I can get additional name suggestions for my project.

**Detailed Workflow:** When clicking "Generate More Names" on a project page, the system should generate additional names using the existing project context and display them in the results area with proper loading states and feedback.

### Logo Gallery Implementation

As a user, I want access to a logo gallery so that I can view and manage generated logos for my projects.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users should be able to access a logo gallery that displays all generated logos, provides options to view, download, or regenerate logos, and integrates with the existing logo generation workflow.

### AI-First Experience

As a user, I expect the application to use AI by default without asking me to enable it, since that's the core value proposition.

**Detailed Workflow:** Remove the AI toggle/enable button and make AI generation the default behavior. Users should not need to explicitly enable AI features as the entire application is built around AI-powered name generation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Generation Style Button Toggle** - Fix button states to allow selection and deselection
2. **Sidebar Text Removal** - Clean up collapsed sidebar to remove all text elements
3. **Generate More Names Functionality** - Implement working name generation on project pages
4. **Logo Gallery Implementation** - Create functional logo gallery with viewing and management capabilities
5. **AI Default Behavior** - Remove AI toggle and make AI generation the default experience

## Out of Scope

- New generation modes or AI model integrations beyond existing functionality
- Complete UI redesign or major visual changes beyond the specific issues identified
- Performance optimizations not directly related to the identified problems

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional button interactions** with proper toggle states for generation style selection
2. **Clean collapsed sidebar** with no visible text or letter elements
3. **Working Generate More Names button** that produces additional name suggestions with proper user feedback
