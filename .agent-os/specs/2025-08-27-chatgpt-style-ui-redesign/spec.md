> Spec: ChatGPT-Style UI Redesign
> Created: 2025-08-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a complete UI redesign following a ChatGPT-style interface pattern with persistent sidebar navigation, session-based idea management, and streamlined workflow. The interface will provide a familiar, intuitive experience where users can create new ideas, iterate on them, and easily navigate between past sessions through a persistent left sidebar.

## User Stories

### New User Journey

As a new user, I want to land on a dashboard that's immediately ready for input, so that I can start generating names without any friction.

When I visit the application for the first time, I'm presented with a clean interface featuring a focused textarea for entering my business idea. The textarea is automatically focused on page load, inviting me to begin typing immediately. After submitting my idea, a new "session" is created with an auto-generated slug, and I'm redirected to a dedicated page for that idea where I can generate names, create logos, and iterate on the concept. This page becomes the permanent home for this idea, allowing me to return at any time to continue where I left off.

### Returning User Workflow

As a returning user with existing ideas, I want to easily navigate between my past ideas and create new ones, so that I can manage multiple naming projects efficiently.

The left sidebar displays all my previous ideas in a scrollable list, similar to ChatGPT's conversation history. Each idea shows a preview title derived from the initial input. I can click any past idea to return to its dedicated page with all previous generations and results intact. When I want to start fresh, I click the prominent "New Idea" button at the top of the sidebar, which takes me back to the clean dashboard input interface.

### Power User Session Management

As a power user with many ideas, I want efficient session management capabilities, so that I can organize and navigate my extensive idea history.

The sidebar supports infinite scrolling to accommodate unlimited ideas. I can search through my ideas, rename them for better organization, and potentially archive or delete old sessions. The interface remains performant even with hundreds of saved ideas, using virtualization techniques similar to modern chat applications.

## Spec Scope

1. **Dashboard with Auto-Focus Input** - Clean landing page with textarea that auto-focuses on load, ready for immediate idea input
2. **Session-Based Idea Management** - Each submitted idea creates a persistent session with auto-generated slug and dedicated page
3. **ChatGPT-Style Sidebar Navigation** - Left sidebar showing all past ideas with infinite scroll, search, and session management
4. **Dedicated Idea Pages** - Persistent pages for each idea maintaining state for name generation, logo creation, and all iterations
5. **Seamless Navigation Flow** - "New Idea" button for returning to dashboard, click-to-navigate for past sessions

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and multi-user support (maintaining current single-user approach)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile app or native application development
- Import/export of ideas from external sources
- Advanced analytics or reporting on idea performance

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional ChatGPT-style interface with persistent sidebar showing all past ideas and supporting infinite scroll
2. Dashboard page that auto-focuses textarea on load and accepts new idea submissions
3. Individual idea pages with stable URLs that preserve all generation history and allow continued iteration on return visits
