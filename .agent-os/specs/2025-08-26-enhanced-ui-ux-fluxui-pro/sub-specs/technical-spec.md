# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-enhanced-ui-ux-fluxui-pro/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**Component Migration Strategy**
- Audit all existing FluxUI free components across the application
- Create mapping between free and Pro component variants
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period
- Preserve existing Alpine.js interactions and Livewire bindings

**Advanced Table Features**
- Implement client-side sorting for generated name results
- Add filtering capabilities for domain status, name length, and characteristics
- Maintain responsive design across all table enhancements
- Integrate with existing pagination systems

**Modal Dialog Implementation**
- Create reusable modal components for different content types
- Implement backdrop click and ESC key dismissal
- Ensure accessibility compliance with ARIA attributes
- Support nested modals where necessary for complex workflows

**Toast Notification System**
- Support multiple notification types: success, error, warning, info
- Implement auto-dismiss timers with user override capability
- Position notifications to avoid interface obstruction
- Queue multiple notifications with stacking behavior

**Form Enhancement Requirements**
- Real-time validation feedback with visual state indicators
- Enhanced error message positioning and styling
- Improved accessibility with screen reader support
- Maintain existing form submission and validation logic

## Approach

**Component Upgrade Approach**
The implementation will follow a systematic component-by-component upgrade approach rather than a wholesale replacement. This ensures stability and allows for testing at each step.

**Phase 1: Core Component Migration** (Days 1-2)
Replace fundamental components like buttons, inputs, and basic layout elements with their Pro variants. This establishes the foundation for more complex upgrades.

**Phase 2: Interactive Component Enhancement** (Days 3-4)  
Upgrade table, modal, and form components that require behavioral changes. Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding Pro features.

**Phase 3: Notification and Polish** (Days 5-7)
Implement the toast notification system and apply final polish to all upgraded components. Complete comprehensive testing and refinement.

**Rationale:** This phased approach minimizes risk by allowing incremental testing and validation. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring that fundamental components are stable before adding complex interactive features.

## External Dependencies

**FluxUI Pro Components**
- Already installed and available in the project
- No additional package installations required
- Leverage existing Pro component library

**Alpine.js Integration**  
- Maintain compatibility with existing Alpine.js directives
- No version changes required
- Ensure Pro components work seamlessly with current Alpine patterns

**TailwindCSS Compatibility**
- Verify Pro component styles integrate with existing Tailwind classes
- No additional CSS framework dependencies
- Maintain current responsive design patterns
