# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-photo-gallery/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-02
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### File Upload System
- Support multiple file formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- Drag-and-drop interface with progress indicators
- Client-side image validation and compression
- Chunked upload for large files (>10MB)
- Maximum file size limit of 50MB per image
- Storage integration with Laravel's filesystem abstraction

### Image Processing Pipeline
- Automatic thumbnail generation (multiple sizes: 150x150, 300x300, 600x400)
- Image optimization and compression
- Metadata extraction (EXIF data, dimensions, color analysis)
- Background job processing for heavy operations
- CDN integration for optimized delivery

### Gallery Interface
- Responsive grid layout with masonry-style positioning
- Virtual scrolling for performance with large image sets
- Search functionality with tag and metadata filtering
- Bulk operations (delete, tag, move to mood board)
- Keyboard navigation support

### Mood Board Creator
- Drag-and-drop interface for image arrangement
- Real-time collaboration support (future consideration)
- Multiple layout templates (grid, collage, freeform)
- Export functionality (PDF, high-resolution image)
- Public sharing with unique tokens

### AI Vision Integration
- Integration with OpenAI Vision API for image analysis
- Style and mood detection from uploaded images
- Color palette extraction for logo generation context
- Visual similarity matching for name suggestions

### UI Theme Customization System
- Real-time theme preview with CSS custom properties
- Predefined theme collection (Professional, Creative, Minimalist, Dark, High Contrast)
- Custom color picker with accessibility validation (contrast ratios)
- CSS variable injection for dynamic theme application
- Theme persistence across browser sessions and devices
- Export/import theme configurations for sharing

## Approach Options

**Option A: Full Laravel Implementation**
- Pros: Complete control, tight integration, consistent architecture
- Cons: More development time, need to build all components

**Option B: Third-party Service Integration (Cloudinary/ImageKit)**
- Pros: Fast implementation, professional image processing, CDN included
- Cons: External dependency, ongoing costs, less control

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Selected)
- Pros: Laravel for business logic, external service for processing/CDN
- Cons: Slightly more complex architecture
- **Rationale**: Balances development speed with control and performance

## External Dependencies

- **Intervention/Image v3** - Image processing and manipulation
  - **Justification**: Laravel-native image processing library with excellent performance
- **Spatie/Laravel-Medialibrary** - Media management and conversions
  - **Justification**: Battle-tested library with conversion chains and CDN support
- **OpenAI PHP Client** - AI vision analysis integration
  - **Justification**: Required for analyzing images to provide naming context
- **TinyColor PHP** - Color manipulation and accessibility validation
  - **Justification**: Needed for contrast ratio calculations and color palette generation

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for gallery views
- Image compression and WebP conversion
- CDN integration for global delivery
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Caching for image metadata and processing status
- Background job processing for heavy operations
